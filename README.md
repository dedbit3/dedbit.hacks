# About

This site/repo is my personal pentesting portfolio. It contains methodical, hands-on writeups of capture-the-flag style labs, red-team exercises, and personal projects. Each write-up aims to teach both _how_ an issue was found and _how_ to detect and remediate it.

Purpose: learn, teach, and demonstrate, security work.

## What’s in this repo

- `writeups/` — step-by-step guides for individual targets (recon → exploitation → post-exploitation → remediation).
    
- `toolbox/` — scripts, helpers, and PoCs used in the writeups.
    
- `detection/` — Sigma rules, YARA, Snort/Suricata signatures, and SIEM detection ideas derived from findings.
    
- `notes/` — short, focused posts on techniques (e.g., AD abuse, Kerberos, C2, phishing).
    
- `assets/` — screenshots, pcap extracts, and diagrams used in posts.
    
- `README.md` — this file.
