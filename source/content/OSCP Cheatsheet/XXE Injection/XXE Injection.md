XML External Entity


**XXE (XML External Entity) injection** is a type of security flaw that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's XML input. It occurs when an application accepts XML input that includes external entity references within the XML itself. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to disclose local files, make server-side requests, or execute remote code

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language used to transform and format XML documents. While XSLT is primarily used for data transformation and formatting, it is also significantly relevant to XXE (XML External Entities) attacks.


SLT can be used to facilitate XXE attacks in several ways:  

1. **Data Extraction**: XSLT can be used to extract sensitive data from an XML document, which can then be used in an XXE attack. For example, an XSLT stylesheet can extract user credentials or other sensitive information from an XML file.
2. **Entity Expansion**: XSLT can expand entities defined in an XML document, including external entities. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious entities, leading to an XXE vulnerability.
3. **Data Manipulation**: XSLT can manipulate data in an XML document, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious data or modify existing data to exploit an XXE vulnerability.
4. **Blind XXE**: XSLT can be used to perform blind XXE attacks, in which an attacker injects malicious entities without seeing the server's response.


### What are DTDs?

DTDs or Document Type Definitions define the structure and constraints of an XML document. They specify the allowed elements, attributes, and relationships between them. DTDs can be internal within the XML document or external in a separate file.

Purpose and usage of DTDs:

- **Validation**: DTDs validate the structure of XML to ensure it meets specific criteria before processing, which is crucial in environments where data integrity is key.
- **Entity Declaration**: DTDs define entities that can be used throughout the XML document, including external entities which are key in XXE attacks.  
    

Internal DTDs are specified using the `<!DOCTYPE` declaration, while external DTDs are referenced using the SYSTEM keyword.

### DTDs and XXE

DTDs play a crucial role in XXE injection, as they can be used to declare external entities. External entities can reference external files or URLs, which can lead to malicious data or code injection.

### XML Entities

XML entities are placeholders for data or code that can be expanded within an XML document. There are five types of entities: internal entities, external entities, parameter entities, general entities, and character entities.

Example external entity:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY external SYSTEM "http://example.com/test.dtd">
<config>
&external;
</config>
```

This shows an external entity referencing a URL. The `&external;` reference within the XML document will be expanded to the contents of the referenced URL.

### Types of Entities

1. Internal Entities are essentially variables used within an XML document to define and substitute content that may be repeated multiple times. They are defined in the DTD (Document Type Definition) and can simplify the management of repetitive information. For example:
    
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE note [
    <!ENTITY inf "This is a test.">
    ]>
    <note>
            <info>&inf;</info>
    </note>
    ```
    
    In this example, the `&inf;` entity is replaced by its value wherever it appears in the document.
    
2. External Entities are similar to internal entities, but their contents are referenced from outside the XML document, such as from a separate file or URL. This feature can be exploited in XXE (XML External Entity) attacks if the XML processor is configured to resolve external entities. For example:
    
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE note [
    <!ENTITY ext SYSTEM "http://example.com/external.dtd">
    ]>
    <note>
            <info>&ext;</info>
    </note>
    ```
    
    Here, `&ext;` pulls content from the specified URL, which could be a security risk if the URL is controlled by an attacker.
    
3. Parameter Entities are special types of entities used within DTDs to define reusable structures or to include external DTD subsets. They are particularly useful for modularizing DTDs and for maintaining large-scale XML applications. For example:
    
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE note [
    <!ENTITY % common "CDATA">
    <!ELEMENT name (%common;)>
    ]>
    <note>
            <name>John Doe</name>
    </note>
    ```
    
    In this case, `%common;` is used within the DTD to define the type of data that the `name` element should contain.
    
4. General Entities are similar to variables and can be declared either internally or externally. They are used to define substitutions that can be used within the body of the XML document. Unlike parameter entities, general entities are intended for use in the document content. For example:
    
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE note [
    <!ENTITY author "John Doe">
    ]>
    <note>
            <writer>&author;</writer>
    </note>
    ```
    
    The entity `&author;` is a general entity used to substitute the author's name wherever it's referenced in the document.
    
5. Character Entities are used to represent special or reserved characters that cannot be used directly in XML documents. These entities prevent the parser from misinterpreting XML syntax. For example:
    
    - `&lt;` for the less-than symbol (`<`)
    - `&gt;` for the greater-than symbol (`>`)
    - `&amp;` for the ampersand (`&`)
    
    ```xml
    <note>
            <text>Use &lt; to represent a less-than symbol.</text>
    </note>
    ```
    
    This usage ensures that the special characters are processed correctly by the XML parser without breaking the document's structure.

### XML Parsing

XML parsing is the process by which an XML file is read, and its information is accessed and manipulated by a software program. XML parsers convert data from XML format into a structure that a program can use (like a DOM tree). During this process, parsers may validate XML data against a schema or a DTD, ensuring the structure conforms to certain rules.

If a parser is configured to process external entities, it can lead to unauthorized access to files, internal systems, or external websites.

### Common XML Parsers

Several XML parsers are used across different programming environments; each parser may handle XML data differently, which can affect vulnerability to XXE injection.

- **DOM (Document Object Model) Parser**: This method builds the entire XML document into a memory-based tree structure, allowing random access to all parts of the document. It is resource-intensive but very flexible.
- **SAX (Simple API for XML) Parser**: Parses XML data sequentially without loading the whole document into memory, making it suitable for large XML files. However, it is less flexible for accessing XML data randomly.
- **StAX (Streaming API for XML) Parser**: Similar to SAX, StAX parses XML documents in a streaming fashion but gives the programmer more control over the XML parsing process.
- **XPath Parser**: Parses an XML document based on expression and is used extensively in conjunction with XSLT.



### In-Band vs Out-of-Band XXE

In-band XXE refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker can see the response from the server. This allows for straightforward data exfiltration and exploitation. The attacker can simply send a malicious XML payload to the application, and the server will respond with the extracted data or the result of the attack.

Out-of-band XXE, on the other hand, refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker cannot see the response from the server. This requires using alternative channels, such as DNS or HTTP requests, to exfiltrate data. To extract the data, the attacker must craft a malicious XML payload that will trigger an out-of-band request, such as a DNS query or an HTTP request.

### In-Band XXE Exploitation

We will be using [Burp](https://tryhackme.com/module/learn-burp-suite) for this room. To demonstrate this vulnerability, go to [http://10.201.4.182/contact.php](http://10.201.4.182/contact.php), and fill outÂ the form.

![Homepage of the application](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/db8f3f703dd6b8641d5555ed6ead1b49.png)  

Click the submit button and intercept the request.

![Intercepted request of the contact form](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/734c868f5e54ae3b3d0c3539301f2256.png)  

The submitted data is processed by contact_submit.php, which contains a vulnerable PHP code designed to return the value of the name parameter when a user submits a message in the form. Below is the vulnerable code:

```php
libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $xmlData = file_get_contents('php://input');

    $doc = new DOMDocument();
    $doc->loadXML($xmlData, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD); 

    $expandedContent = $doc->getElementsByTagName('name')[0]->textContent;

    echo "Thank you, " .$expandedContent . "! Your message has been received.";
}
```

Since the application returns the value of the name parameter, we can inject an entity that is pointing to `/etc/passwd` to disclose its values.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<contact>
<name>&xxe;</name>
<email>test@test.com</email>
<message>test</message>
</contact>
```

Using the payload above, replace the initial XML data submitted to contact_submit.php and resend the request.

### XML Entity Expansion

XML Entity Expansion is a technique often used in XXE attacks that involves defining entities within an XML document, which the XML parser then expands. Attackers can abuse this feature by creating recursive or excessively large entities, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or defining external entities referencing sensitive files or services. This method is central to both in-band and out-of-band XXE, as it allows attackers to inject malicious entities into the XML data. For example:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "This is a test message" >]>
<contact><name>&xxe; &xxe;
</name><email>test@test.com</email><message>test</message></contact>
```

In the payload above, `&xxe;` is expanded wherever it appears. Attackers can use entity expansion to perform a Billion Laughs attack, where a small XML document recursively expands to consume server resources, leading to a denial of service.

### Avoiding Misconfigurations

Misconfigurations in XML parser settings are a common cause of XXE-related vulnerabilities. Adjusting these settings can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks. Below are detailed guidelines and best practices for several popular programming languages and frameworks.

### General Best Practices

1. **Disable External Entities and DTDs**: As a best practice, disable the processing of external entities and DTDs in your XML parsers. Most XXE vulnerabilities arise from malicious DTDs.
2. **Use Less Complex Data Formats**: Where possible, consider using simpler data formats like JSON, which do not allow the specification of external entities.
3. **Allowlisting Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data against a strict schema that defines expected data types and patterns.Â Exclude or escape XML-specific characters such as <, >, &, ', and ". These characters are crucial in XML syntax and can lead to injection attacks if misused.

### Mitigation Techniques in Popular Languages

**Java**

Use the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and disable DTDs:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
```

**.NET**

Configure XML readers to ignore DTDs and external entities:

```csharp
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;
settings.XmlResolver = null;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);
```

**PHP**

Disable loading external entities by libxml:

```php
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
```

**Python**

Use `defusedxml` library, which is designed to mitigate XML vulnerabilities:

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xml_input)
```

### Regularly Update and Patch

- **Software Updates**: Keep all XML processors and libraries up-to-date. Vendors frequently patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches to web applications and their environments.

### Security Awareness and Code Reviews

- **Conduct Code Reviews**: Regularly review code for security vulnerabilities, especially code that handles XML input and parsing.
- **Promote Security Training**: Ensure developers are aware of secure coding practices, including the risks associated with XML parsing.
