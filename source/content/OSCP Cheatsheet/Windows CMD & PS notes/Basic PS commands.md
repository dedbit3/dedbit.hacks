Notes
---

*Remember in PS you are dealing with objects and you are accessing 
properties (characteristics) and  methods (actions).*

*Verb-Noun format for cmdlet*
- `Get-Content`: Retrieves (gets) the content of a file and displays it in the console.
- `Set-Location`: Changes (sets) the current working directory.

*List all cmdltes available for use*
`Get-Command`

*Lists how to use cmdlet*
`Get-Help`

*Get-Alias shows alises on the system*
For example, `dir` is an alias for `Get-ChildItem`, and `cd` is an alias for `Set-Location`.

*Modules can either be binaries or powershell scripts -> the add cmdlet's, functions and vars for use*
`Import-Module`
`Remove-Module`
`Install-Module`

*Can look for modules in repositories to install*
`Find-Module`

*Comparison operators*
- `-eq`
- `-ne`: "**not equal**". This operator can be used to exclude objects from the results based on specified criteria.
- `-gt`: "**greater than**". This operator will filter only objects which exceed a specified value. It is important to note that this is a strict comparison, meaning that objects that are equal to the specified value will be excluded from the results.
- `-ge`: "**greater than or equal to**". This is the non-strict version of the previous operator. A combination of `-gt` and `-eq`.
- `-lt`: "**less than**". Like its counterpart, "greater than", this is a strict operator. It will include only objects which are strictly below a certain value.
- `-le`: "**less than or equal to**". Just like its counterpart `-ge`, this is the non-strict version of the previous operator. A combination of `-lt` and `-eq`.

 *Like a pattern*
`-like`


The last in this set of filtering cmdlets is `Select-String`. This cmdlet searches for text patterns within files, similar to `grep` in Unix-based systems or `findstr` in Windows Command Prompt. Itâ€™s commonly used for finding specific content within log files or documents

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
```

---

```
Select-String <- grep equivalent

Get-NetIPConfiguration <- ipconfig equivalent
```

`Get-ComputerInfo` <- more powerful eq of systeminfoGet-Service <- services are the equivalent of daemons on linux

Other Useful Cmdlets

Get-Process
Get-NetTCPConnection
Get-FileHash
```

Supports regex statements as well
`Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property Length -gt 100`

`WDAGUtilityAccount` <- virtualized environment for edge protects against malware pretty 
cool
