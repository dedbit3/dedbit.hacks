Hello I’m Edu, a Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at Purdue University. I’m passionate about exploring emerging technologies and frameworks through a security-first lens. I’m particularly interested in red teaming, penetration testing, and malware reverse engineering, and I enjoy writing code here and there to automate workflows, build tooling, and solve practical problems.

I built this site to document my cybersecurity projects, technical write-ups, and research notes, creating a central and concise space to organize and share my knowledge.


Feel free to look around and explore!
