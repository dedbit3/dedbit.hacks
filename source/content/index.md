Hello I’m Edu, a Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at Purdue University. I’m passionate about exploring emerging technologies and frameworks through a security-first lens. I’m particularly interested in red teaming, penetration testing, and malware reverse engineering, and I enjoy writing code here and there to automate workflows, build tooling, and solve practical problems.

I built this site to document my cybersecurity projects, technical write-ups, and research notes, creating a central and concise space to organize and share my knowledge.

Some of the projects I’ve completed span both offensive and defensive cybersecurity, as well as enterprise-grade networking and infrastructure engineering. I’ve designed and deployed complete Layer 2 and Layer 3 network topologies featuring VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, load balancing, and redundancy protocols such as HSRP and VRRP. I’ve implemented dynamic routing with EIGRP, OSPF, and RIP to ensure high availability and fault tolerance across simulated enterprise environments. On the security side, I’ve developed **process injection proofs-of-concept in C** to explore Windows internals and defensive evasion techniques, and I’ve engineered and maintained **comprehensive detection ecosystems**—including EDR solutions, SIEM platforms, centralized log aggregation, honeypots, mail servers, and multi-domain Active Directory environments. These projects have allowed me to integrate networking, automation, and security principles into cohesive lab infrastructures for testing, research, and red/blue team training.

Feel free to look around and explore!
