Hello! These are my personal notes for some of the HTB machines I have pwned. As a warning some of these notes are not polished at all and mostly written to help me organize myself as I complete the machines. Although there are some that are much better structured than others. I assure you I can write better notes when that is the objective (just trust me).

P.S. Don't worry formatting this is on my TODO list
